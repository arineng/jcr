        <abstract>
            <t>
                This document describes a language for specifying and testing the expected content of JSON structures
                found in JSON-using protocols, software, and processes.
            </t>
        </abstract>
    </front>
    <middle>
        <section title="Motivation">
            <t>
                As a growing number of protocols use JSON, there is an increasing need to find better mechanisms
                to help define such protocols.
            </t>
            <t>
                In the past, protocols often used constrained alphabet strings. Such strings could be defined by
                example, but it was found better to use Backus-Naur Form (BNF), or variants such
                as ABNF. The benefit of using ABNF over examples is that the full variation of what is allowed in a
                protocol can be expressed in a single location. This leads to easier implementation and better
                interoperability.
            </t>
            <t>
                As protocols migrate to being defined in JSON, the same need to define the valid set of JSON
                messages arises. It is conceivable to define the JSON-based message set by way of examples. But as
                with constrained alphabet strings, this can be cumbersome, incomplete and easily misinterpreted,
                leading to the problems of implementation and interoperability mentioned earlier.
            </t>
            <t>
                It would be theoretically possible to express the valid set of a protocol’s JSON messages using ABNF.
                However, ABNF is difficult to get right at the best of times, and defining an ABNF that simultaneously
                interwove the constraints of JSON and the constraints of the protocol into a single ABNF definition
                would be a task few could, or would, want to achieve. Even if such were possible, much of what was
                intended to describe the protocol, would be obscured by the aspects describing the JSON
                constraints. Such an approach is likely to end up being only comprehendible by a machine, and be
                impenetrable to humans. As such, arguably, such a definition would not satisfy it primary target
                audience.
            </t>
            <t>
                The solution is to move up a level of abstraction. In the same way JSON is a level of abstraction
                above constrained alphabet strings for representing protocols, a similar move up in abstraction level
                is needed for the mechanism used to define such protocols.
            </t>
            <t>
                JSON Content Rules (JCR) is such a step up in abstraction. It’s relation to JSON is that of ABNF to
                constrained string alphabets. By ‘knowing’ about JSON it can more accurately and concisely define
                JSON messages than other methods that are less abstracted. In the same way that abstracted
                languages such as Java and Python enable a programmer to work more efficiently than they can with
                assembler, protocol developers can work more efficiently using JCR than they can with ABNF.
            </t>
            <t>
                That said, JCR is not the only language in this space nor the only solution, beyond ABNF, to this
                problem. Of the various method and languages that the authors know about, in addition to JCR,
                there are format translators which algorithmically convert a specification from one format to
                another (e.g. XML to JSON), abstraction languages such as Yang and CDDL, and at least one other JSON
                specific language: JSON Schema.
            </t>
            <section title="Format Translation">
                <t>
                    Format translation is an algorithmic approach to specifying protocol messages in multiple formats
                    by using one format as the base specification and an algorithm for translating that formatting
                    into another. One example would be the translation of XML into JSON using the BadgerFish
                    algorithm and software.
                </t>
                <t>
                    This approach often creates difficult protocol messages in the destination format (i.e. JSON in
                    the case of XML to JSON) which are hard to implement towards or debug. Additionally, while it be
                    fashionable to have multiple formats, most software implementations of protocols work best with
                    one format and often not well with others if at all.
                </t>
                <t>
                    vCard and jCard are good examples of this. The original format and data model for vCard
                    are specified in MIME. jCard is an algorthmic conversion of vCard to jCard. Consequently,
                    writing software implementations of jCard requires software developers to have an intimate
                    knowledge of MIME, saving them little in the way of time or effort.
                </t>
            </section>
            <section title="Abstraction Languages">
                <t>
                    Abstraction languages are nothing new to the schema and data definition language space, with ASN.1
                    being a classic example of specifying a data model in a higher level syntax and defined algorithms
                    for multiple data formats. ASN.1 has many, such as BER and DER and XER (XML Encoding Rules).
                    Yang is a more modern and popular abstraction languages.
                </t>
                <t>
                    These languages have their place but suffer the same issues as format translators as they
                    require software implementors to spend valuable energy on a syntax that is not specific to the
                    software being implemented. Additionally, abstraction languages have, in many instances, specified
                    features in the data model that do not translate well to all data formats or may lack compelling
                    features because the langauge must cater to multiple formats.
                </t>
                <t>
                    With respect to JSON, CDDL is an abstraction language as it's data model is a superset of the
                    data model of JSON. In other words, it is possible to specify protocol messages in CDDL that are
                    not applicable to JSON. And because CDDL targets CBOR specifically, it does not benefit from being
                    a superset of JSON, as is the case of JCR, or specified in JSON, as is the case of JSON Schema.
                </t>
            </section>
            <section title="JSON Schema vs JCR">
                <t>
                    JSON Schema, like JCR, is a data definition language designed specifically for JSON. And while JCR
                    is more tightly scoped to defining JSON protocol messages and content, JSON Schema is more
                    broadly scoped in its goals. From a high-level view point, it could be said that JSON Schema is
                    like XML Schema whereas JCR is more like Compact RelaxNG.
                </t>
                <t>
                    JSON Schema benefits from being defined in JSON (as this makes implementations of JSON Schema tools
                    easier), but this benefit impacts readability of specifications defining content using it. To
                    demonstrate, the following examples define JSON using the classic example of a catolog object.

                    The above examples demonstrate that the JCR is more concise and conveys the same
                    information but in fewer lines in a syntax familiar with a JSON-aware software
                    implementor.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Additionally, JCR is a superset of JSON whereby specification authors may use example
                    JSON protocol messages as a starting point for defining JCR rules (as is described in
                    <xref target="a_first_example"></xref>). Combined with the brevity of describing rules
                    and the ability to name rules, specification authors may also interleave their prose
                    with JCR rules in their specifications thus describing semantics in close proximity
                    to syntax.

                This document describes JSON Content Rules (JCR), a language
                for specifying and testing the interchange of data
                in <xref target="RFC8259">JSON</xref> format used by computer protocols and processes.
                The syntax of JCR is not JSON but is "JSON-like", possessing the conciseness and
                utility that has made JSON popular.

                    The following JSON data describes a JSON object with two members, "line-count" and
                    "word-count", each containing an integer.

                <t>
                    This is also JCR that describes a JSON object with a member named "line-count" that is
                    an integer that is exactly 3426 and a member named "word-count" that is an integer that
                    is exactly 27886.
                </t>
                <t>
                    For a protocol specification, it is probably more useful to specify that each member
                    is any integer and not specific, exact integers:

                <t>
                    Since line counts and word counts should be either zero or a positive integer,
                    the specification may be further narrowed:

                    For the purposes of writing a protocol specification, JCR may be broken down into
                    named rules to reduce complexity and to enable re-use. The following example takes
                    the JCR from above and rewrites the members as named rules.

                    With each member specified as a named rule, software testers can override them locally
                    for specific test cases. In the following example, the named rules are locally overridden
                    for the test case where the file name is "rfc4627.txt".

                    In this example, the protocol specification describes the JSON object in general and

        <section title="Overview of the Language">
            <t>
                JCR is composed of rules (as the name suggests). A collection of rules that is processed
                together is a ruleset. Rulesets may also contain comments, blank lines, and directives
                that apply to the processing of a ruleset.
            </t>
            <t>
                Rules are composed of two parts, an optional rule name and
                a rule specification.  A rule specification can be either a type
                specification or a member specification.  A member specification
                consists of a member name specification and a type specification.
            </t>
            <t>
                A type specification is used to specify constraints on a superset
                of a JSON value (e.g. number / string / object / array etc.).  In
                addition to defining primitive types (such as string or integer),
                array types, and object types, type specifications may define the
                JCR specific concept of group types.
            </t>
            <t>
                Type specifications corresponding to arrays, objects and groups may
                be composed of other rule specifications.
            </t>
            <t>
                A member specification is used to specify constraints on a JSON
                member (i.e. members of a JSON object).
            </t>
            <t>
                Rules with rule name assignments may be referenced in place of
                type specifications and member specifications.
            </t>
            <t>
                Rules may be defined across line boundaries and there is no line
                continuation syntax. 
            </t>
            <t>
                Any rule consisting only of a type specification is considered a root rule. Unless otherwise
                specified, all the root rules of a ruleset are evaluated against a JSON instance or document.

                Rules may be defined across line boundaries.
                Blank lines are allowed.
            </t>
            <t>
                Comments are the same as comments in <xref target="RFC4234">ABNF</xref>. They start with a semi-colon (';') and

            </t>
            <t>
                Type specifications define arrays, objects, etc... of JSON and may reference other rules
                using rule names. Most type specifications can be defined with repetitions for specifying
                the frequency of the type being defined. In addition to the type specifications describing
                JSON types, there is an additional group specification for grouping types.
            </t>
            <t>
                Member specifications define members of JSON objects, and are composed of a member name specification
                and either a type specification or a rule name referencing a type specification.
            </t>
            <t>
                Rules may also contain annotations which may affect the evaluation of all or part of a rule.
                Rules without a rule name assignment are considered root rules, though rules with a rule
                name assignment can be considered a root rule with the appropriate annotation.
            </t>
            <t>
                Type specifications, depending on their type, can contain zero or more other
                specifications or rule names. For example, an object specification might contain multiple
                member specifications or rule names that resolve to member specifications or a mixture
                of member specifications and rule names. For the purposes of this document, specifications
                and rule names composing other specifications are called subordinate components.

            <section title="Rule Names and Assignments">
                <t>
                    Rule names are signified with the dollar character ('$'), which is not part of the
                    rule name itself. Rule names have two components, an optional ruleset identifier alias and a local
                    rule name.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Local rule names must start with an alphabetic character (a-z,A-Z) and must contain only
                    alphabetic characters, numeric characters, the hyphen character ('-') and the
                    underscore character ('_'). Local rule names are case sensitive, and must be unique
                    within a ruleset (that is, no two rule name assignments may use the same local rule name).
                </t>
                <t>
                    Ruleset identifier aliases enable referencing rules from another ruleset. They are not allowed in rule
                    name assignments, and only found in rule names referencing other rules. Ruleset identifiers must start with
                    an alphabetic character and contain no whitespace. Ruleset identifiers are case sensitive.
                    Simple use cases of JCR will most likely not use ruleset identifiers.

                    Rule name assignments separate the rule name from the type specification using the '='

                    the character sequence '=:'.

                can be given either as a quoted string using double quotes or as a regular expression
                using forward slash ('/') characters. Regular expressions are not implicitly anchored

                    Because subordinate components of an object specification are evaluated in the order
                    in which they are specified (i.e. left to right, top to bottom) and object members
                    can only match one subordinate component of an object specification, the rule o1 below
                    will not match against the JSON in <xref target="object_order_eval.json"></xref> but

                    The first subordinate of rule o1 specifies that an object can have zero or more members
                    (that is the meaning of "*", see <xref target="repetition"></xref>) where the member
                    name is the letter 'p' followed by a number (e.g. "p0", "p1", "p2"), and the second
                    rule specifies a member with the exact member name of "p1". Rule o2
                    has the exact same member specifications but in the opposite order. 
                    <xref target="object_order_eval.json"></xref> does not match rule o1 because all of the
                    members match the first subordinate rule leaving none to match the second subordinate rule.
                    However, rule o2 does match because the first subordinate rule matches only one member
                    of the JSON object allowing the second subordinate rule to match the other member of
                    the JSON object.

                As stated above, members of objects which do not match a rule are ignored.
                The reason for this validation model is due to the nature of the typical
                access model to JSON objects in many programming languages, where members
                of the object are obtained by referencing the member name. Therefore
                extra members may exist without harm.
            </t>
            <t>
                However, some specifications may need to restrict the members of a JSON
                object to a known set. To construct a rule specifying that no
                extra members are expected, the @{not} annotation (see <xref target="not_annotation"></xref>)
                may be used with
                a "match-all" regular expression as the last subordinate component of the object specification.

                    The following rule will match the JSON object in <xref target="restrict_objects1.json"></xref>
                    but will not match the JSON object in <xref target="restrict_objects2.json"></xref>.

                This works because subordinate components are evaluated in the order they
                appear in the object rule, and the last component accepts any member with
                any type but fails to validate if one or more of those components are found
                due to the @{not} annotation.

                Array specifications define JSON arrays and are composed of zero or more subordinate

                group specification. The subordinate components are enclosed at the start with a left

                    <t>
                        If any items of the array are not matched, then the array does not match

                Unlike object specifications, order is implied in array specifications by default.
                That is, the first subordinate component will match the first element of the array, 
                the second subordinate component will match the second element of the array, and so on.

                If an array has more elements than can be matched from the array specification,
                the array does not match the array specification. Or stated differently, an array with unmatched
                elements does not validate. Using the example array rule a2 from above, the following
                array does not match because the last element of the array does not match any subordinate

                they are contained. For example, a group specification
                inside of an array specification may not contain a member specification since member specifications are not

                    The evaluation of a group specification inside an array specification inherits the ordering property
                    of the array specification. If the array specification is unordered, then the items of the group specification
                    are also considered to be unordered. And if the array specification is ordered, then the items
                    of the group specification are also considered to be ordered.

                    (',') followed by another subordinate component.

                    Evaluation of subordinate components in array, object, and group specifications may be succeeded by
                    a repetition expression denoting how many times the subordinate component should be
                    evaluated. 
                    Repetition expressions are specified using a Kleene symbol ('?', '+', or '*') or with
                    the '*' symbol succeeded by specific minimum and/or maximum values, each being non-negative integers. Repetition expressions
                    may also be appended with a step expression, which is the '%' symbol followed by a positive integer.

                    In object and array specifications, there may be situations in which it is necessary to
                    condition the existence of a subordinate component on the existence of a sibling subordinate
                    component. In other words, example_two should only be evaluated if example_one
                    evaluates positively. Or put another way, a member of an object or an item of an
                    array may be present only on the condition that another member or item is present.

                    Augmented OR of objects is an algorithm for better writing of OR, where the

                            JCR currently has 'ipaddr', 'ipv4', and 'ipv6' data types, but often
                            groups of IP addresses are specified using CIDR notation. 'cidr', 'cidr4',
                            'cidr6' are under consideration to cover these data types.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            The 'any' type covers all value type specifications: objects, arrays, and
                            primitives. There may be cases where narrowing to a specific value type is
                            desired, so 'anyobject', 'anyarray', and 'anyprimitive' are under consideration.

            <section title="New Annotations">
                <t>
                    JCR can be extended through the use of annotation but also has a set of standard
                    annotations. The design philosophy for annotations are to provide features to the
                    language that are not as common or do not have a clear, less-wordy syntax.
                </t>
                <t>
                    The following annotations are under consideration:
                    <list>
                        <t>
                            A '@{default ...}' annotation has been proposed to help the reader understand
                            there may be a default value if one is not given. This annotation does not provide
                            much value for validation and is intended as a reading aid to provide semantic
                            information.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            Both '@{minExclusive ...}' and '@{maxExclusive ...}' annotations have been proposed
                            to avoid adding extra arcane syntax for excluding the boundaries of numeric ranges.
                        </t>
                        <t>
                            A '@{augments RULENAME}' or '@{extends RULENAME}' annotation has been discussed to
                            provide a better extension mechanism of rules.

        <section title="Co-Constraints">
            <t>
                This specification defines a small set of annotations and directives for JCR, yet
                the syntax is extensible allowing for other annotations and directives.
                <xref target="I-D.cordell-jcr-co-constraints"></xref> ("Co-Constraints for JCR") defines further
                annotations and directives which define more detailed constraints on JSON
                messages, including co-constraints (constraining parts of JSON message based
                on another part of a JSON message).

        <section title="Testing Against JSON Content Rules">
            <t>
                One aspect of JCR that differentiates it from other format schema languages are
                the mechanisms helpful to developers for taking a formal specification, such as
                that found in an RFC, and evolving it into unit tests, which are essential to
                producing quality protocol implementations.
            </t>
            <section title="Locally Overriding Rules">
                <t>
                    As mentioned in the introduction, one tool for testing would be the
                    ability to locally override named rules. As an example, consider the
                    following rule which defines an array of strings.
                </t>
                <figure anchor="override1.jcr">
                    <artwork xml:space="preserve" align="center">&override1.jcr;</artwork>
                </figure>
                <t>
                    Consider the specification where this rule is found does not define the
                    values but references an extensible list of possible values updated
                    independently of the specification, such as in an IANA registry.
                </t>
                <t>
                    If a software developer desired to test a specific situation in which the
                    array must at least contain the status "accepted", the rules from the specification
                    could be used and the statuses rule could be explicitly overridden locally as:
                </t>
                <figure anchor="override2.jcr">
                    <preamble>
                        This rule will evaluate positively with the JSON in <xref target="override1.json"></xref>
                    </preamble>
                    <artwork xml:space="preserve" align="center">&override2.jcr;</artwork>
                </figure>
                <figure anchor="override1.json">
                    <artwork xml:space="preserve" align="center">&override1.json;</artwork>
                </figure>
                <t>
                    Alternatively, the developer may need to ensure that the status "denied" should
                    not be present in the array:
                </t>
                <figure anchor="override3.jcr">
                    <preamble>
                        This rule will fail to evaluate the JSON in <xref target="override2.json"></xref>
                        thus signaling a problem.
                    </preamble>

                <t>
                    In many testing scenarios, the evaluation of rules may become more complex
                    than that which can be expressed in JCR, sometimes involving variables and
                    interdependencies which can only be expressed in a programming language.
                </t>
                <t>
                    A JCR processor may provide a mechanism for the execution of local functions
                    or methods based on the name of a rule being evaluated. Such a mechanism
                    could pass to the function the data to be evaluated, and that function could
                    return to the processor the result of evaluating the data in the function.

        <section title="Changes from -09 and -10" anchor="changes">
            <t>
                The syntax of JCR was changed so that rule name assignments to primitive types
                no longer requires the '=:' syntax. The '=:' is still provided for backwards
                compatibility. Other syntax changes have been made to accommodate the syntax
                of future annotations.
