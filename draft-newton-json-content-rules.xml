                This document describes a language for specifying and testing the expected content of JSON structures
                found in JSON-using protocols, software, and processes.

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
                This document describes JSON Content Rules (JCR), a language
                for specifying and testing the interchange of data
                in <xref target="RFC7159">JSON</xref> format used by computer protocols and processes.
                The syntax of JCR is not JSON but is "JSON-like", possessing the conciseness and
                utility that has made JSON popular.
            </t>
            <section title="A First Example: Specifying Content">
                <t>
                    The following JSON data describes a JSON object with two members, "line-count" and
                    "word-count", each containing an integer.                    
                </t>
                <figure>
                    <artwork xml:space="preserve" align="center">&first_example.json;</artwork>
                </figure>
                <t>
                    This is also JCR that describes a JSON object with a member named "line-count" that is
                    an integer that is exactly 3426 and a member named "word-count" that is an integer that
                    is exactly 27886.
                </t>
                <t>
                    For a protocol specification, it is probably more useful to specify that each member
                    is any integer and not specific, exact integers:
                </t>
                <figure>
                    <artwork xml:space="preserve" align="center">&first_example.jcr;</artwork>
                </figure>
                <t>
                    Since line counts and word counts should be either zero or a positive integer,
                    the specification may be further narrowed:
                </t>                
                <figure>
                    <artwork xml:space="preserve" align="center">&first_example2.jcr;</artwork>
                </figure>
            </section>
            <section title="A Second Example: Testing Content">
                <t>
                    Building on the first example, this second example describes the same object
                    but with the addition of another member, "file-name".
                </t>
                <figure>
                    <artwork xml:space="preserve" align="center">&second_example.json;</artwork>
                </figure>                
                <t>
                    The following JCR describes objects like it.
                </t>
                <figure>
                    <artwork xml:space="preserve" align="center">&second_example.jcr;</artwork>
                </figure>                
                <t>
                    For the purposes of writing a protocol specification, JCR may be broken down into
                    named rules to reduce complexity and to enable re-use. The following example takes
                    the JCR from above and rewrites the members as named rules.
                </t>
                <figure>
                    <artwork xml:space="preserve" align="center">&second_example2.jcr;</artwork>
                </figure>                
                <t>
                    With each member specified as a named rule, software testers can override them locally
                    for specific test cases. In the following example, the named rules are locally overridden
                    for the test case where the file name is "rfc4627.txt".
                </t>                
                <figure>
                    <artwork xml:space="preserve" align="center">&second_example_override.jcr;</artwork>
                </figure>      
                <t>
                    In this example, the protocol specification describes the JSON object in general and
                    an implementation overrides the rules for testing specific cases.
                </t>
            </section>
        </section>
        <section title="Overview of the Language">
            <t>
                JCR is composed of rules (as the name suggests). A collection of rules that is processed
                together is a ruleset. Rulesets may also contain comments, blank lines, and directives
                that apply to the processing of a ruleset.
            </t>
            <t>
                Rules are composed of two parts, an optional rule name assignment and a type specification.
                Rules may be defined across line boundaries and there is no line continuation syntax. The
                type specification component of rules are a superset of JSON.
            </t>
            <t>
                Rules with rule name assignments may be referenced in the type specifications of other rules.
                And type specifications, depending on their type, may be composed of other type specifications.
                Type specifications define arrays, objects, members of objects, primitive types, and groups
                of types.
            </t>
            <t>
                Any rule consisting only of a type specification is considered a root rule. Unless otherwise
                specified, all the root rules of a ruleset are evaluated against a JSON instance or document.
            </t>

            <t>
                There is no statement terminator and therefore no need for a line continuation syntax.
                Rules may be defined across line boundaries.
                Blank lines are allowed.
            </t>
            <t>
                Comments are very similar to comments in <xref target="RFC4234">ABNF</xref>. They start with a semi-colon (';') and
                continue to the end of the line.
            </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Rules">
            <t>
                Rules have two main components, an optional rule name assignment and a type specification.
                Type specifications define arrays, objects, etc... of JSON and may reference other rules
                using rule names. Most type specifications can be defined with repetitions for specifying
                the frequency of the type being defined. In addition to the type specifications describing
                JSON types, there is an additional group specification for grouping types.
            </t>
            <t>
                Rules may also contain annotations which may affect the evaluation of all or part of a rule.
                Rules without a rule name assignment are considered root rules, though rules with a rule
                name assignment can be considered a root rule with the appropriate annotation.
            </t>
            <t>
                Type specifications, depending on their type, can contain zero or more other type
                specifications or rule names. For example, an object specification might contain multiple
                member specifications or rules names that resolve to member specifications or a mixture
                of member specifications and rule names. For the purposes of this document, type specifications
                and rule names composing other type specifications are called subordinate components.
            </t>
            <section title="Rule Names and Assignments">
                <t>
                    Rule names are signified with the dollar character ('$'), which is not part of the
                    rule name itself. Rule names have two components, an optional ruleset identifier and a local
                    rule name.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Local rule names must start with an alphabetic character (a-z,A-Z) and must contain only
                    alphabetic characters, numeric characters, the hyphen character ('-') and the
                    underscore character ('_'). Local rule names are case sensitive, and must be unique
                    within a ruleset (that is, no two rule name assignements may use the same local rule name).
                </t>
                <t>
                    Ruleset identifiers reference rules from another ruleset. They are not allowed in rule
                    name assignments, and only found in the directive specifying the ruleset identifier for
                    a ruleset and rule names referenced by other rules. Ruleset identifiers must start with
                    an alphabetic character and contain no whitespace. Ruleset identifiers are case sensitive.
                    Simple use cases of JCR will most likely not use ruleset identifiers.
                </t>

                </figure>
                <t>
                    There are two forms of rule name assignments: assignements of primitive types and assignments
                    of all other types. Rule name assignments to primitive type specifications separate the rule
                    name from the type specification with the character sequence '=:', whereas rule name assignments
                    for all other type specifications only require the separation using the '=' character.
                </t>

                    This is the one little "gotcha" in JCR. This syntax is necessary so that JCR parsers may
                    distinguish between rules name assignments involving primitives and object member type
                    specifications involving primitives.

                    zero or more annotations.
                    Each annotation begins with the
                    character sequence "@{" and ends with "}". The following is an example of a type specification

                subordinate components, each of which can be either a
                rule name, member specification, or group specification. The subordinate components
                are enclosed

            <t>
                It defines two rules, o1 and o2. o1 first specifies that an object can have
                zero or more (that is the meaning of "@*", see <xref target="repetition"></xref>)
                members where the member name is the letter 'p' followed by a number
                (e.g. "p0", "p1", "p2") and then a member with the exact member name "p1". o2
                has the exact same member specifications but in the opposite order.
            </t>
            <t>
                The following JSON will not match o1 but will match o2 because of the order

                Array specifications define JSON arrays and are composed of zero or more subordinate
                components, each of which can either be a rule name or a primitive, array, object or
                group specification. The subordinate components are enclosed at the start with a left
                square brace character ('[') and at the end with a right square brace character (']').

            </figure>
            <t>
                Unlike object specifications, order is implied in array specifications by default.
                That is, the first subordinate component will match the first element of the array, 
                the second subordinate component will match the second element of the array, and so on.
            </t>
            <t>
                Take for example the following ruleset:

            </figure>
            <t>
                It defines two rules, a1 and a2. The array in the following JSON will not match a1, but
                will match a2.

            </figure>
            <t>
                Finally, if an array has more elements than can be matched from the array specification,
                the array does not match the array specification. Or stated differently, an array with unmatched
                elements does not validate. Using the example array rule a2 from above, the following
                array does not match because the last element of the array does not match any subordinate
                component:

                    Array specifications can be made to behave in a similar fashion to object specifications

                    Like ordered array specifications, the subordinate components in an unordered array specification
                    are evaluated in the order they are specified. The difference is that they
                    need not match an element of the array in the same position as given in the
                    array specification.

                <t>
                    Finally, like ordered array specifications, unordered array specifications also require that all elements of the array be
                    matched by a subordinate component. If the array has more elements than can be
                    matched, the array does not match the array specification.

                Unlike the other type specifications, group specifications have no direct tie with JSON syntax.

            <t>
                Group specifications and any nesting of group specifications, must conform
                to the allowable set of type specifications of the type specifications in which
                they are contained. For example, a group specification
                inside of an array specification may not contain a member specification since member specifications are not
                allowed as direct subordinates of array specifications (arrays contain values, not object members in JSON). 
                Likewise, a group specification referenced inside an object
                specification must only contain member specifictions (JSON objects may only contain object members).

                    The evaluation of a group specification inside an array specification inherits the ordering property
                    of the array specification. If the array specification is unordered, then the items of the group specification
                    are also considered to be unordered. And if the array specification is ordered, then the items
                    of the group specification are also considered to be ordered.

                    (',') followed by another subordinate component.
                    A choice is a subordinate component followed by a pipe character ('|') followed by another subordinate component.

                    Evaluation of subordinate components in array, object, and group specifications may be succeeded by
                    a repetition expression denoting how many times the subordinate component should be
                    evaluated. Repetition expressions start with the 'at' character ('@') followed by either
                    a specific repetition value or a minimum to maximum specification or a single character Kleene operator followed by an
                    optional repetition step expression, which is a percent character ('%') followed by an step integer.

                    possible to construct a member rule that matches any member name.
                    As an example, the following defines an object with a member with any name

                    By default, members of objects which do not match a rule are ignored.
                    The reason for this validation model is due to the nature of the typical
                    access model to JSON objects in many programming languages, where members
                    of the object are obtained by referencing the member name. Therefore
                    extra members may exist without harm.
                </t>
                <t>
                    However, some specifications may need to restrict the members of a JSON
                    object to a known set. To construct a rule specifying that no
                    extra members are expected, the @{not} annotation may be used with
                    a regular expression as the last subordinate component of the object specification.

                    This works because subordinate components are evaluated in the order they
                    appear in the object rule, and the last component accepts any member with
                    any type but fails to validate if one ore more of those components are found
                    due to the @{not} annotation.

                    Unlike object validation, array specifications will not validate items of an
                    array that do not match a subordinate component of the array specification. This
                    processing model is due to the nature of the typical access pattern of
                    JSON arrays in many programming languages, which is to iterate over the
                    array. Processes iterating over an array would need to take special
                    steps for extra items of the array that are not specified, especially
                    if the items were of a different type than those that are expected.

                <t>
                    The syntax for group specifications accommodates one ore more subordinate components and
                    a repetition expression for each. Other than grouping multiple rules, a
                    group specification can be used as a macro definition for a single rule.

                    Group rules can be used to create object mixins, a pattern for writing data
                    models similar in style to object derivation in some programming languages.
                    In the example in below,
                    both obj1 and obj2 have a members "foo" and "fob" with obj1 having the additional member "bar"
                    and obj2 having the additional member "baz".

                <t>
                    In object and array specifications, there may be situations in which it is necessary to
                    condition the existence of a subordinate component on the existence of a sibling subordinate
                    component. In other words, example_two should only be evaluated if example_one
                    evaluates positively. Or put another way, a member of an object or an item of an
                    array may be present only on the condition that another member or item is present.
                </t>
                <t>
                    In the following example, the referrer_uri member can only be present if the
                    location_uri member is present.

            <t>
                This specification defines a small set of annotations and directives for JCR, yet
                the syntax is extensible allowing for other annotations and directives.
                <xref target="I-D.cordell-jcr-co-constraints"></xref> ("Co-Constraints for JCR") defines further
                annotations and directives which define more detailed constraints on JSON
                messages, including co-constraints (constraining parts of JSON message based
                on another part of a JSON message).
            </t>

        <section title="Testing Against JSON Content Rules">
            <t>
                One aspect of JCR that differentiates it from other format schema languages are
                the mechanisms helpful to developers for taking a formal specification, such as
                that found in an RFC, and evolving it into unit tests, which are essential to
                producing quality protocol implementations.
            </t>
            <section title="Locally Overriding Rules">
                <t>
                    As mentioned in the introduction, one tool for testing would be the
                    ability to locally override named rules. As an example, consider the
                    following rule which defines an array of strings.
                </t>
                <figure>
                    <artwork xml:space="preserve" align="center">&override1.jcr;</artwork>
                </figure>
                <t>
                    Consider the specification where this rule is found does not define the
                    values but references an IANA registry for extensibility purposes.
                </t>
                <t>
                    If a software developer desired to test a specific situation in which the
                    array must at least contain the status "accepted", the rules from the specification
                    could be used and the statuses rule could be explicitly overridden locally as:
                </t>
                <figure>
                    <artwork xml:space="preserve" align="center">&override2.jcr;</artwork>
                </figure>
                <t>
                    Alternatively, the developer may need to ensure that the status "denied" should
                    not be present in the array:
                </t>
                <figure>
                    <artwork xml:space="preserve" align="center">&override3.jcr;</artwork>
                </figure>
            </section>
            <section title="Rule Callbacks">
                <t>
                    In many testing scenarios, the evaluation of rules may become more complex
                    than that which can be expressed in JCR, sometimes involving variables and
                    interdependencies which can only be expressed in a programming language.
                </t>
                <t>
                    A JCR processor may provide a mechanism for the execution of local functions
                    or methods based on the name of a rule being evaluated. Such a mechanism
                    could pass to the function the data to be evaluated, and that function could
                    return to the processor the result of evaluating the data in the function.

        <section title="Syntax Changes from -06" anchor="syntax_changes">
            <t>
                The syntax described in this document is changed significantly, and in a non-backwards
                compatible manner, from the syntax described in the -06 version of this specification.
                The vast majority of these changes have occured to meet the goals of the syntax being
                a superset of JSON and easy to comprehend by a casual reader unfamiliar with JCR but
                familiar with JSON.
            </t>
            <t>
                The latter of those two goals is subjective, and therefore a series of focus group
                sessions were convened where participants, all professional software developers with
                familiarity with JSON but not JCR, were asked to read and interpret various rulesets
                and allowed to offer suggested improvements. Outcomes of these sessions resulted in
                many changes, such as the use of '$' characters to note rule names and the change of
                the repetition syntax.
            </t>
            <t>
                Other changes came from feedback given directly to the authors via email and on
                the IETF JSON Working Group mailing list.
