1.  Introduction

   This document describes JSON Content Rules (JCR), a language for
   specifying and testing the interchange of data in JSON [RFC8259]
   format used by computer protocols and processes.  The syntax of JCR
   is not JSON but is "JSON-like", possessing the conciseness and
   utility that has made JSON popular.

2.  Motivation

   As a growing number of protocols use JSON, there is an increasing
   need to find better mechanisms to help define such protocols.

   In the past, protocols often used constrained alphabet strings.  Such
   strings could be defined by example, but it was found better to use
   Backus-Naur Form (BNF), or variants such as ABNF.  The benefit of
   using ABNF over examples is that the full variation of what is
   allowed in a protocol can be expressed in a single location.  This
   leads to easier implementation and better interoperability.

   As protocols migrate to being defined in JSON, the same need to
   define the valid set of JSON messages arises.  It is conceivable to
   define the JSON-based message set by way of examples.  But as with
   constrained alphabet strings, this can be cumbersome, incomplete and

   easily misinterpreted, leading to the problems of implementation and
   interoperability mentioned earlier.

   It would be theoretically possible to express the valid set of a
   protocol's JSON messages using ABNF.  However, ABNF is difficult to
   get right at the best of times, and defining an ABNF that
   simultaneously interwove the constraints of JSON and the constraints
   of the protocol into a single ABNF definition would be a task few
   could, or would, want to achieve.  Even if such were possible, much
   of what was intended to describe the protocol, would be obscured by
   the aspects describing the JSON constraints.  Such an approach is
   likely to end up being only comprehendible by a machine, and be
   impenetrable to humans.  As such, arguably, such a definition would
   not satisfy it primary target audience.

   The solution is to move up a level of abstraction.  In the same way
   JSON is a level of abstraction above constrained alphabet strings for
   representing protocols, a similar move up in abstraction level is
   needed for the mechanism used to define such protocols.

   JSON Content Rules (JCR) is such a step up in abstraction.  It's
   relation to JSON is that of ABNF to constrained string alphabets.  By
   'knowing' about JSON it can more accurately and concisely define JSON
   messages than other methods that are less abstracted.  In the same
   way that abstracted languages such as Java and Python enable a
   programmer to work more efficiently than they can with assembler,
   protocol developers can work more efficiently using JCR than they can
   with ABNF.

   That said, JCR is not the only language in this space nor the only
   solution, beyond ABNF, to this problem.  Of the various method and
   languages that the authors know about, in addition to JCR, there are
   format translators which algorithmically convert a specification from
   one format to another (e.g.  XML to JSON), abstraction languages such
   as Yang and CDDL, and at least one other JSON specific language: JSON
   Schema.

2.1.  Format Translation

   Format translation is an algorithmic approach to specifying protocol
   messages in multiple formats by using one format as the base
   specification and an algorithm for translating that formatting into
   another.  One example would be the translation of XML into JSON using
   the BadgerFish algorithm and software.

   This approach often creates difficult protocol messages in the
   destination format (i.e.  JSON in the case of XML to JSON) which are
   hard to implement towards or debug.  Additionally, while it be

Internet-Draft             JSON Content Rules                 April 2018


   fashionable to have multiple formats, most software implementations
   of protocols work best with one format and often not well with others
   if at all.

   vCard and jCard are good examples of this.  The original format and
   data model for vCard are specified in MIME. jCard is an algorthmic
   conversion of vCard to jCard.  Consequently, writing software
   implementations of jCard requires software developers to have an
   intimate knowledge of MIME, saving them little in the way of time or
   effort.

2.2.  Abstraction Languages

   Abstraction languages are nothing new to the schema and data
   definition language space, with ASN.1 being a classic example of
   specifying a data model in a higher level syntax and defined
   algorithms for multiple data formats.  ASN.1 supports many data
   formats, such as BER and DER and XER (XML Encoding Rules).  Yang is a
   more modern and popular abstraction languages.

   These languages have their place but suffer the same issues as format
   translators as they require software implementors to spend valuable
   energy on a syntax that is not specific to the software being
   implemented.  Additionally, abstraction languages have, in many
   instances, specified features in the data model that do not translate
   well to all data formats or may lack compelling features because the
   language must cater to multiple formats.

   With respect to JSON, CDDL is an abstraction language as it's data
   model is a superset of the data model of JSON.  In other words, it is
   possible to specify protocol messages in CDDL that are not applicable
   to JSON.  And because CDDL targets CBOR specifically, it does not
   benefit from being a superset of JSON, as is the case of JCR, or
   specified in JSON, as is the case of JSON Schema.

2.3.  JSON Schema vs JCR

   JSON Schema, like JCR, is a data definition language designed
   specifically for JSON.  And while JCR is more tightly scoped to
   defining JSON protocol messages and content, JSON Schema is more
   broadly scoped in its goals.  From a high-level view point, it could
   be said that JSON Schema is like XML Schema whereas JCR is more like
   Compact RelaxNG.

   JSON Schema benefits from being defined in JSON (as this makes
   implementations of JSON Schema tools easier), but this benefit
   impacts readability of specifications defining content using it.  To

   demonstrate, the following examples define JSON using the classic
   example of a catalog object.

   In this example, the catalog entry is defined in JSON Schema.

        {
          "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-06/schema#",
          "title": "Product",
          "description": "A product from Acme's catalog",
          "type": "object",
          "properties": {
            "id": {
              "description": "The unique identifier for a product",
              "type": "integer"
            },
            "name": {
              "description": "Name of the product",
              "type": "string"
            },
            "price": {
              "type": "number",
              "exclusiveMinimum": 0
            },
            "tags": {
              "type": "array",
              "items": {
              "type": "string"
            },
            "minItems": 1,
            "uniqueItems": true
            }
          },
          "required": ["id", "name", "price"]
        }

   For comparison, this example demonstrates the same catalog entry as
   described in Figure 1 but in JCR.

       #jcr-version 0.9
       ; Product - A Product for Acme's catalog
       {
         "id"    : integer,      ; Unique identifier for the product
         "name"  : string,       ; Name of the product
         "price" : @{min-exclusive} 0.0..,
         "tags"  : [ string + ] ?
       }

                                 Figure 2

   The above examples demonstrate that the JCR is more concise and
   conveys the same information but in fewer lines in a syntax familiar
   with a JSON-aware software implementor.

   Additionally, JCR is a superset of JSON whereby specification authors
   may use example JSON protocol messages as a starting point for
   defining JCR rules (as is described in Section 4.1).  Combined with
   the brevity of describing rules and the ability to name rules,
   specification authors may also interleave their prose with JCR rules
   in their specifications thus describing semantics in close proximity
   to syntax.

3.  Uses

   JCR's primary focus is to help specification authors concisely and
   clearly describe complex JSON data structures.

   Being a precise, defined format reduces the potential for
   misunderstanding between what specification authors intended and what
   software developers implement.

   Being a machine-readable format, the examples in a specification can
   be validated by the specified JCR, and it can be verified that the
   JCR represents the examples.  This acts like unit testing in software
   development.

   JCR aids software developers to verify that their implementations
   conform to specifications by validating any generated JSON against
   the specified JCR.  This can be used to highlight bugs in their code,
   or possibly identify where a specification has omissions and requires
   further work.

   Specific examples of JCR and JSON can be included as part of
   conformance test vector sets to give confidence that an

Internet-Draft             JSON Content Rules                 April 2018


   implementation meets a specification.  JCR's ability to be specific
   in some locations, and loose in others, allows such tests to be run
   on a repeatable, automated basis without requiring detailed human
   involvement.

   JCR can help resolve interoperability issues by acting as an
   independent arbiter between parties experiencing interoperability
   issues.  Appealing to a JCR opinion offers the potential for a quick
   and cheap resolution to a disagreement.  (Naturally, either party may
   disagree with the JCR result and take the matter further.)

   Once software has been developed and deployed, JCR offers the
   potential for day-one in-the-field monitoring of JSON message
   exchanges in order to highlight conformance issues that may have
   slipped through the development phase.

   Being a simple, defined language, JCR can also be used on an ad-hoc
   basis by developers as part of the design process, such as during
   brainstorming and whiteboarding sessions, without risking confusion
   over notation that may occur if an un-documented method is used.

4.  JCR Examples

4.1.  A First Example: Specifying Content

   The following JSON data describes a JSON object with two members,
   "line-count" and "word-count", each containing an integer.

               { "line-count" : 3426, "word-count" : 27886 }

                                 Figure 3

   This is also JCR that describes a JSON object with a member named
   "line-count" that is an integer that is exactly 3426 and a member
   named "word-count" that is an integer that is exactly 27886.

   For a protocol specification, it is probably more useful to specify
   that each member is any integer and not specific, exact integers:

            { "line-count" : integer, "word-count" : integer }

                                 Figure 4

   Since line counts and word counts should be either zero or a positive
   integer, the specification may be further narrowed:

Internet-Draft             JSON Content Rules                 April 2018


                { "line-count" : 0.. , "word-count" : 0.. }

                                 Figure 5

4.2.  A Second Example: Testing Content

   Building on the first example, this second example describes the same
   object but with the addition of another member, "file-name".

                      {
                        "file-name"  : "rfc7159.txt",
                        "line-count" : 3426,
                        "word-count" : 27886
                      }

                                 Figure 6

   The following JCR describes objects like it.

                         {
                           "file-name"  : string,
                           "line-count" : 0..,
                           "word-count" : 0..
                         }

                                 Figure 7

   For the purposes of writing a protocol specification, JCR may be
   broken down into named rules to reduce complexity and to enable re-
   use.  The following example takes the JCR from above and rewrites the
   members as named rules.

                        {
                          $fn,

   With each member specified as a named rule, software testers can
   override them locally for specific test cases.  In the following
   example, the named rules are locally overridden for the test case
   where the file name is "rfc4627.txt".

   in general and an implementation overrides the rules for testing
   specific cases.

5.  Overview of the Language

   JCR is composed of rules (as the name suggests).  A collection of
   rules that is processed together is a ruleset.  Rulesets may also
   contain comments, blank lines, and directives that apply to the
   processing of a ruleset.

   Rules are composed of two parts, an optional rule name and a rule
   specification.  A rule specification can be either a type
   specification or a member specification.  A member specification
   consists of a member name specification and a type specification.

   A type specification is used to specify constraints on a superset of
   a JSON value (e.g. number / string / object / array etc.).  In
   addition to defining primitive types (such as string or integer),
   array types, and object types, type specifications may define the JCR
   specific concept of group types.

   Type specifications corresponding to arrays, objects and groups may
   be composed of other rule specifications.

   A member specification is used to specify constraints on a JSON
   member (i.e. members of a JSON object).

   Rules that have a rule name may be referenced in place of rule
   specifications.

   Rules may be defined across line boundaries and there is no line
   continuation syntax.

   Any rule without a rule name is considered a root rule.  Such a rule
   MUST be a type specification.  Unless otherwise specified, all the
   root rules of a ruleset are evaluated against a JSON instance or
   document.

   Rule specifications may be augmented with annotations to specify
   additional constraints and properties.  For example, arrays can be
   augmented with an 'unordered' annotation to indicate that the order
   of its members isn't significant.

   The syntax of each type of type specifications varies depending on
   the type.  For example:

Internet-Draft             JSON Content Rules                 April 2018


6.1.  Lines and Comments

   There is no statement terminator and therefore no need for a line
   continuation syntax.  Rules may be defined across line boundaries.
   Blank lines are allowed.

   Comments are the same as comments in ABNF [RFC4234].  They start with
   a semi-colon (';') and continue to the end of the line.

6.2.  Names and Identifiers

   JCR uses names and identifiers to enable cross-referencing one part
   of a ruleset with another, or from one ruleset to another.  There are
   different types of names and different type of identifiers.  For
   example, a local rule name is a name, and a ruleset-id is an
   identifier.

   A name must start with an ASCII alphabetic character (a-z,A-Z) and
   must contain only ASCII alphabetic characters, numeric characters,
   the hyphen character ('-') and the underscore character ('_').  Names
   are case sensitive.

   An identifier must start with an ASCII alphabetic character (a-z,A-Z)
   and can be followed by any character other than whitespace and the
   closing brace ('}').  Identifiers are treated as opaque strings, and
   therefore case-sensitive.

6.3.  Rules

   Rules have two main components, an optional rule name assignment and
   a type or member specification.

   Type specifications define arrays, objects, etc... of JSON and may
   reference other rules using rule names.  Most type specifications can
   be defined with repetitions for specifying the frequency of the type
   being defined.  In addition to the type specifications describing
   JSON types, there is an additional group specification for grouping
   types.

   Member specifications define members of JSON objects, and are
   composed of a member name specification and either a type
   specification or a rule name referencing a type specification.

   Rules may also contain annotations which may affect the evaluation of
   all or part of a rule.  Rules without a rule name assignment are
   considered root rules, though rules with a rule name assignment can
   be considered a root rule with the appropriate annotation.




Newton & Cordell         Expires October 5, 2018               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft             JSON Content Rules                 April 2018


   Type specifications, depending on their type, can contain zero or
   more other specifications or rule names.  For example, an object
   specification might contain multiple member specifications or rule
   names that resolve to member specifications or a mixture of member
   specifications and rule names.  For the purposes of this document,
   specifications and rule names composing other specifications are
   called subordinate components.

6.4.  Rule Names and Assignments

   Rule names are used to represent rule specifications so they can be
   referenced elsewhere in a ruleset.  A rule name can be used in two
   scenarios; rule specification assignment, and rule specification
   referencing.

   Rule names are signified with the dollar character ('$'), which is
   not part of the rule name itself.  Rule names have two components, an
   optional ruleset identifier alias and a local rule name.  If a
   ruleset identifier alias is present, it is separated from the local
   rule name by a dot character ('.').  Both ruleset identifier aliases
   and local rule names are types of name (see Section 6.2).

   When a rule specification is assigned to a rule name, only the local
   rule name part can be present.  In this scenario the local rule name
   must be unique within a ruleset (that is, no two rule name
   assignments may use the same local rule name).

   Ruleset identifier aliases may be included in a rule name that is
   used as a reference.  They enable referencing rules from another
   ruleset.  Simple use cases of JCR will most likely not use ruleset
   identifiers.

   In Figure 10 below, "http://ietf.org/rfcYYYY.JCR" and
   "http://ietf.org/rfcXXXX.JCR" are ruleset identifiers and "rfcXXXX"
   is a ruleset identifier alias.

          # ruleset-id http://ietf.org/rfcYYYY.JCR
          # import http://ietf.org/rfcXXXX.JCR as rfcXXXX
          $my_encodings  = ( "mythic" | "magic" )
          $all_encodings = ( $rfcXXXX.encodings | $my_encodings )

                                 Figure 13

   Rule name assignments separate the rule name from the type
   specification using the '=' character.

6.5.  Annotations

   Annotations may appear before a rule name assignment, before a type
   or member specification, or before a rule name contained within a
   type specification.  In each place, there may be zero or more
   annotations.  Each annotation begins with the character sequence "@{"
   and ends with "}".  The following is an example of a type
   specification with the not annotation:

                     @{not} [ "fruits", "vegatables" ]

                                 Figure 15

   The @{not} annotation is described in Section 6.17.

   The @{root} annotation is described in Section 6.6.

   The @{unordered} annotation is described in Section 6.12.1.

   The @{min-exclusive} and @{max-exclusive} annotations are described
   in Section 6.8.3.

   Other annotations may be defined for other purposes in future.

6.6.  Starting Points and Root Rules

   Evaluation of a JSON instance or document against a ruleset begins
   with the evaluation of a root rule or set of root rules.  If no root
   rule (or rules) is specified locally at runtime, the set of root
   rules specified in the ruleset are evaluated.  The order of
   evaluation is undefined.

   The set of root rules specified in a ruleset is composed of all rules
   without a rule name assignment and all rules annotated with the
   "@{root}" annotation.

Internet-Draft             JSON Content Rules                 April 2018


   The "@{root}" annotation may either appear before a rule name
   assignment or before a type definition.  It is ignored if present
   before referenced rule name inside of a type specification.

6.7.  Type Specifications

   Type specifications consist of primitive specifications, objects
   specification, array specifications and group specifications.  Each
   of these are described in the sections below.

6.8.  Primitive Specifications

   Primitive type specifications define content for JSON numbers,
   booleans, strings, and null.

6.8.1.  Null

   The rule for a null type specification is the simplest and takes the
   following form:

                                   null

                                 Figure 16

   A JSON instance value specified to be null must have the null value
   to be valid.

6.8.2.  Booleans

   The rules for booleans take the following forms:

                                  true
                                  false
                                  boolean

                                 Figure 17

   A JSON instance value specified to be true must have the true value
   to be valid.  If specified to be false, it must have the false value.
   If specified to be boolean, it must have either the true or false
   values.

6.8.3.  Numbers

   Rules for numbers can specify a JSON instance value to be either an
   integer or floating point number:

                                  integer
                                  float
                                  double

                                 Figure 18

   The keyword 'float' represents a single precision IEEE-754 floating
   point number represented in decimal.  The keyword 'double' represents
   a double precision IEEE-754 floating point number represented in
   decimal format.

   Numbers may also be specified as an absolute value or a range of
   possible values, where a range may be specified using a minimum,
   maximum, or both:

                                   n
                                   n..m
                                    ..m
                                   n..
                                 n.f
                                 n.f..m.f
                                    ..m.f
                                 n.f..

                                 Figure 19

   When specifying a minimum and a maximum, both must either be an
   integer or a floating point number.  Thus to specify a floating point
   number between zero and ten a definition of the following form is
   used:

                                 0.0..10.0


                                 Figure 20

   When a range is used to define an integer or a float, by default the
   minimum and maximum values are included in the range.  The @{min-
   exclusive} annotation can be specified to exclude the minimum from
   the range and the @{max-exclusive} annotation can be specified to
   exclude the maximum from the range.

   The size of integers may also be specified using bit lengths.  The
   type name is constructed with a prefix followed by a number.  The
   prefix 'int' specifies a signed integer and the prefix 'uint'
   specifies an unsigned integer.  The number that follows is a positive
   integer that specifies the number of bits in the integer.

6.8.4.  Plain Strings

   Generically, a string may be specified using the word 'string'.
   String literals may be specified using a double quote character
   followed by the literal content followed by another double quote.
   Regular expressions can be specified by enclosing a regular
   expression within the forward slash ('/') character.

   Regular expressions are not implicitly anchored and therefore must be
   explicitly anchored if necessary.

   Regular expressions SHOULD use the ECMA 262 dialect used by
   JavaScript.  This is mostly a sub-set of the common regular
   expression dialects, and any regular expression thus defined should
   be usable in any mainstream regular expression engine.

6.8.5.  Strings with Additional Semantics

   JCR provides a large number of data types beyond those defined by
   JSON.  They are encoded in JSON instances using JSON strings.

   A string can be specified as a URI [RFC3986] using the word 'uri',
   but also may be more narrowly scoped to a URI of a specific scheme.
   Specific URI schemes are specified with the word 'uri' followed by
   two period characters ('..') followed by the URI scheme.

                     ; any URI
                     uri

                     ;a URI narrowed for an HTTPS uri
                     uri..https

                                 Figure 24

   IP addresses may be specified with either the word 'ipv4' for IPv4
   addresses [RFC1166] or the word 'ipv6' for IPv6 addresses [RFC5952].
   Fully qualified A-label and U-label domain names may be specified

6.9.  Any Type

   The 'any' type specifies that a JSON value instance can be any
   primitive type, array type, or object type.

6.10.  Member Specifications

   Member specifications define members of JSON objects.  Unlike other
   type specifications, member specifications cannot be root rules and
   must be part of an object specification or preceded by a rule name
   assignment.

   Member specifications consist of a member name specification followed
   by a colon character (':') followed by either a subordinate
   component, which is either a rule name or a primitive, object, array,
   or group specification.  Member name specifications can be given
   either as a quoted string using double quotes or as a regular
   expression using forward slash ('/') characters.  Regular expressions
   are not implicitly anchored and therefore must have explicit anchors
   if needed.

            ;member name will exactly match "locationURI"
            $location_uri = "locationURI" : uri

            ;member name will match "eth0", "eth1", ... "eth9"
            $iface_mappings = /^eth[0-9]$/  : ipv4

   Member specification validation is described in Section 6.11.

Internet-Draft             JSON Content Rules                 April 2018


6.11.  Object Specifications

   Object specifications define JSON objects and are composed of zero or
   more subordinate components, each of which can be either a rule name,
   member specification, or group specification.  The subordinate
   components are enclosed at the start with a left curly brace
   character ('{') and at the end with a right curly brace character
   ('}').

   Evaluation of the subordinate components of object specifications is
   as follows:

   o  No order is implied for the members of the object being evaluated.

   o  Subordinate components of the object specification are evaluated
      in the order they appear.

   o  Each member of the object being evaluated can only match one
      subordinate component.

   o  Any members not matched against a subordinate component are
      ignored.

   The following examples illustrate matching of JSON objects to JCR
   object specifications.

   As order is not implied for the members of objects under evaluation,
   the following rule will match the JSON in Figure 29 and Figure 30.

              { "locationUri" : uri, "statusCode" : integer }

                                 Figure 28

       { "locationUri" : "http://example.com", "statusCode" : 200 }

                                 Figure 29

       { "statusCode" : 200, "locationUri" : "http://example.com" }

Internet-Draft             JSON Content Rules                 April 2018


   Because subordinate components of an object specification are
   evaluated in the order in which they are specified (i.e. left to
   right, top to bottom) and object members can only match one
   subordinate component of an object specification, the rule o1 below
   will not match against the JSON in Figure 32 but the rule o2 below
   will match it.

             ; zero or more members that match "p0", "p1", etc
             ; and a member that matches "p1"
             $o1 = { /^p\d+$/ : integer *, "p1" : integer }

             ; a member that matches "p1" and
             ; zero or more members that match "p0", "p1", etc
             $o2 = { "p1" : integer, /^p\d+$/ : integer * }

   The first subordinate of rule o1 specifies that an object can have
   zero or more members (that is the meaning of "*", see Section 6.16)
   where the member name is the letter 'p' followed by a number (e.g.
   "p0", "p1", "p2"), and the second rule specifies a member with the
   exact member name of "p1".  Rule o2 has the exact same member
   specifications but in the opposite order.  Figure 32 does not match
   rule o1 because all of the members match the first subordinate rule
   leaving none to match the second subordinate rule.  However, rule o2
   does match because the first subordinate rule matches only one member
   of the JSON object allowing the second subordinate rule to match the
   other member of the JSON object.

                                 Figure 31

                          { "p0" : 1, "p1" : 2 }

                                 Figure 32

   As stated above, members of objects which do not match a rule are
   ignored.  The reason for this validation model is due to the nature
   of the typical access model to JSON objects in many programming
   languages, where members of the object are obtained by referencing
   the member name.  Therefore extra members may exist without harm.

   However, some specifications may need to restrict the members of a
   JSON object to a known set.  To construct a rule specifying that no
   extra members are expected, the @{not} annotation (see Section 6.17)
   may be used with a "match-all" regular expression as the last
   subordinate component of the object specification.

Internet-Draft             JSON Content Rules                 April 2018


   The following rule will match the JSON object in Figure 34 but will
   not match the JSON object in Figure 35.

                { "foo" : 1, "bar" : 2, @{not} // : any + }

                                 Figure 33

                         { "foo" : 1, "bar" : 2 }

                                 Figure 34

                    { "foo" : 1, "bar" : 2, "baz" : 3 }

                                 Figure 35

   This works because subordinate components are evaluated in the order
   they appear in the object rule, and the last component accepts any
   member with any type but fails to validate if one or more of those
   components are found due to the @{not} annotation.

6.12.  Array Specifications

   Array specifications define JSON arrays and are composed of zero or
   more subordinate components, each of which can either be a rule name
   or a primitive, array, object or group specification.  The
   subordinate components are enclosed at the start with a left square
   brace character ('[') and at the end with a right square brace
   character (']').

   Evaluation of the subordinate components of array specifications is
   as follows:

   o  The order of array items is implied unless the @{unordered}
      annotation is present.

   o  Subordinate components of the array specification are evaluated in
      the order they appear.

   o  Each item of the array being evaluated can only match one
      subordinate component of the array specification.

   o  If any items of the array are not matched, then the array does not
      match the array specification.

   These rules are further explained in the examples below.

                            [ 0..1024, 0..980 ]

                                 Figure 36

   Unlike object specifications, order is implied in array
   specifications by default.  That is, the first subordinate component
   will match the first element of the array, the second subordinate
   component will match the second element of the array, and so on.

   Take for example the following ruleset:

           ; the first element of the array is to be a string
           ; the second element of the array is to be an integer
           $a1 = [ string, integer ]

           ; the first element of the array is to be an integer
           ; the second element of the array is to be a string
           $a2 = [ integer, string ]

                                 Figure 37

   It defines two rules, a1 and a2.  The array in the following JSON
   will not match a1, but will match a2.

                            [ 24, "Bob Smurd" ]

                                 Figure 38

   If an array has more elements than can be matched from the array
   specification, the array does not match the array specification.  Or
   stated differently, an array with unmatched elements does not
   validate.  Using the example array rule a2 from above, the following
   array does not match because the last element of the array does not
   match any subordinate component:

            [ 24, "Bob Smurd", "http://example.com/bob_smurd" ]

                                 Figure 39

   To allow an array to contain any value after guaranteeing that it
   contains the necessary items, the last subordinate component of the
   array specification should accept any item:

           ; the first element of the array is to be an integer
           ; the second element of the array is to be a string
           ; anything else can follow
           $a3 = [ integer, string, any * ]

   The JSON array in Figure 39 will validate against the a3 rule in this
   example.

                                 Figure 40

6.12.1.  Unordered Array Specifications

   Array specifications can be made to behave in a similar fashion to
   object specifications with regard to the order of matching with the
   @{unordered} annotation.

   In the ruleset below, a1 and a2 have the same subordinate components
   given in the same order. a2 is annotated with the @{unordered}
   annotation.

                  $a1 =              [ string, integer ]
                  $a2 = @{unordered} [ string, integer ]

                                 Figure 41

   The JSON array below does not match a1 but does match a2.

                            [ 24, "Bob Smurd" ]

                                 Figure 42

   The @{unordered} annotation can only be applied to an array as a
   whole.  It can not be applied to groups within an array.

   Like ordered array specifications, the subordinate components in an
   unordered array specification are evaluated in the order they are
   specified.  The difference is that they need not match an element of
   the array in the same position as given in the array specification.

   Finally, like ordered array specifications, unordered array
   specifications also require that all elements of the array be matched
   by a subordinate component.  If the array has more elements than can
   be matched, the array does not match the array specification.

Internet-Draft             JSON Content Rules                 April 2018


6.13.  Group Specifications

   Unlike the other type specifications, group specifications have no
   direct tie with JSON syntax.  Group specifications simply group
   together their subordinate components.  Group specifications enclose
   one or more subordinate components with the parenthesis characters.

   Group specifications and any nesting of group specifications, must
   conform to the allowable set of type specifications of the type
   specifications in which they are contained.  For example, a group
   specification inside of an array specification may not contain a
   member specification since member specifications are not allowed as
   direct subordinates of array specifications (arrays contain values,
   not object members in JSON).  Likewise, a group specification
   referenced inside an object specification must only contain member
   specifications (JSON objects may only contain object members).

   The following is an example of a group specification:

             $the_bradys = [ $parents, $children ]

             $children = ( "Greg", "Marsha", "Bobby", "Jan" )

             $parents = ( "Mike", "Carol" )

                                 Figure 43

   Like the subordinate components of array and object specifications,
   the subordinate components of a group specification are evaluated in
   the order they appear.

6.14.  Ordered and Unordered Groups in Arrays

   Section 6.12.1 specifies that arrays can be evaluated by the order of
   the items in the array or can be evaluated without order.
   Section 6.13 specifies that arrays may have group rules as
   subordinate components.

   The evaluation of a group specification inside an array specification
   inherits the ordering property of the array specification.  If the
   array specification is unordered, then the items of the group
   specification are also considered to be unordered.  And if the array
   specification is ordered, then the items of the group specification
   are also considered to be ordered.

6.15.  Sequence and Choice Combinations in Array, Object, and Group
       Specifications

   Combinations of subordinate components in array, object, and group
   specifications can be specified as either a sequence ("and") or a
   choice ("or").  A sequence is a subordinate component followed by the
   comma character (',') followed by another subordinate component.  A
   choice is a subordinate component followed by a pipe character ('|')
   followed by another subordinate component.

                            ; sequence ("and")
                            [ "this" , "that" ]

                            ; choice ("or")
                            [ "this" | "that" ]

                                 Figure 44

   Sequence and choice combinations cannot be mixed, and group
   specifications must be used to explicitly declare precedence between
   a sequence and a choice.  Therefore, the following is illegal:

                     [ "this", "that" | "the_other" ]

                                 Figure 45

   The example above should be expressed as:

                   [ "this", ( "that" | "the_other" ) ]

                                 Figure 46

      NOTE: A future specification will clarify the choice ('|')
      operation as inclusive or, exclusive or ("xor") or otherwise.  At
      present readers should assume the choice ('|') operator is an
      inclusive or.  However, for objects and unordered arrays that is
      not ideal, nor is xor.  We are in the process of defining an
      algorithm to "rewrite" choices of rules for use with inclusive or
      which is more suitable for the data model of JSON.

6.16.  Repetition in Array, Object, and Group Specifications

   Evaluation of subordinate components in array, object, and group
   specifications may be succeeded by a repetition expression denoting
   how many times the subordinate component should be evaluated.
   Repetition expressions are specified using a Kleene symbol ('?', '+',
   or '*') or with the '*' symbol succeeded by specific minimum and/or
   maximum values, each being non-negative integers.  Repetition

Internet-Draft             JSON Content Rules                 April 2018


   expressions may also be appended with a step expression, which is the
   '%' symbol followed by a positive integer.

   When no repetition expression is present, both the minimum and
   maximum are 1.

   A minimum and maximum can be expressed by giving the minimum followed
   by two period characters ('..') followed by the maximum, with either
   the minimum or maximum being optional.  When the minimum is not
   explicitly specified, it is assumed to be zero.  When the maximum is
   not explicitly specified, it is assumed to be positive infinity.

                      ; exactly 2 octets
                      $word = [ $octet *2 ]
                      $octet =: int8

                      ; 1 to 13 name servers
                      [ $name_servers *1..13 ]
                      $name_servers =: fqdn

                      ; 0 to 99 ethernet addresses
                      { /^eth.*/ : $mac_addr *..99 }
                      $mac_addr =: hex

                      ; four or more bytes
                      [ $octet *4.. ]

                                 Figure 47

   The allowable Kleene operators are the question mark character ('?')
   which specifies zero or one (i.e. optional), the plus character ('+')
   which specifies one or more, and the asterisk character ('*') which
   specifies zero or more.

                  ; age is optional
                  { "name" : string, "age" : integer ? }

                  ; zero or more errors
                  $error_set = ( string * )

                  ; 1 or more integer values
                  [ integer + ]

                                 Figure 48

   A repetition step expression may follow a minimum to maximum
   expression or the zero or more Kleene operator or the one or more
   Kleene operator.

   o  When the repetition step follows a minimum to maximum expression
      or the zero or more Kleene operator ('*'), it specifies that the
      total number of repetitions present in the JSON instance being
      validated minus the minimum repetition value must be a multiple of
      the repetition step (e.g. the total repetitions minus the minimum
      repetition value must be divisible by the step value with a
      remainder of zero).

   o  When the repetition step follows a one or more Kleene operator
      ('+'), the minimum repetition value is set equal to the repetition
      step value and the total number of repetitions minus the step
      value must be a multiple of the repetition step value.

   The following is an example for repetition steps in repetition
   expressions.

             ; there must be at least 2 name servers
             ; there may be no more than 12 name servers
             ; there must be an even number of name servers
             ; e.g. 2,4,6,8,10,12
             [ $name_servers *2..12%2 ]

6.17.  Negating Evaluation

   The evaluation of a rule can be changed with the @{not} annotation.
   With this annotation, a rule that would otherwise match does not, and
   a rule that would not have matched does.

            ; match anything that isn't the integer 2
            $not_two = [ @{not} 2 ]

            ; error if one of the status values is "fail"
            $status = @{not} @{unordered} [ "fail", string * ]

                                 Figure 50

6.18.  Directives

   Directives modify the processing of a ruleset.  There are two forms
   of the directive, the single line directive and the multi-line
   directive.

   Single line directives appear on their own line in a ruleset, begin
   with a hash character ('#') and are terminated by the end of the
   line.  They take the following form:

               # directive_name parameter_1 parameter_2 ...

                                 Figure 51

   Multi-line directives also appear on their own lines, but may span
   multiple lines.  They begin with the character sequence "#{" and end
   with "}".  The take the following form:

                        #{ directive_name
                            parameter_1 paramter_2
                            parameter_3
                            ...
                        }

                                 Figure 52

   This specification defines the directives "jcr-version", "ruleset-
   id", and "import", but other directives may be defined.

6.18.1.  jcr-version

   This directive declares that the ruleset complies with a specific
   version of this standard.  The version is expressed as a major
   integer followed by a period followed by a minor integer.

                             # jcr-version 0.7

                                 Figure 53

   The major.minor number signifying compliance with this document is
   "0.9".  Upon publication of this specification as an IETF proposed
   standard, it will be "1.0".

                             # jcr-version 1.0

                                 Figure 54

   This directive may have optional extension identifiers following the
   version number.  Each extension identifiers is preceded by the plus
   ('+') character and separated by white space.  The format of
   extension identifiers is specific to the extension, but it is
   recommended that they are terminated by a version number.

            # jcr-version 1.0 +co-constraints-1.2 +jcr-doc-1.0

                                 Figure 55

   A maximum of one jcr-version directive is permitted in a ruleset.
   Ruleset authors are advised to place this directive as the first line
   of a ruleset.

6.18.2.  ruleset-id

   This directive identifies a ruleset to rule processors.  It takes the
   form:

                          # ruleset-id identifier

                                 Figure 56

   An identifier can be a URL (e.g. http://example.com/foo), an inverted
   domain name (e.g. com.example.foo) or any other form that conforms to
   the JCR ABNF syntax that a ruleset author deems appropriate.  To a
   JCR processor the identifier is treated as an opaque, case-sensitive
   string.

   A maximum of one ruleset-id directive is permitted in a ruleset.  If
   present, it is suggested that it be the second line of a ruleset,
   following the jcr-version directive, or the first line if no jcr-
   version directive is present.

Internet-Draft             JSON Content Rules                 April 2018


6.18.3.  import

   The import directive specifies that another ruleset is to have its
   rules evaluated in addition to the ruleset where the directive
   appears.

   The following is an example:

              # import http://example.com/rfc9999 as rfc9999

                                 Figure 57

   The rule names of the ruleset to be imported may be referenced by
   prepending the alias followed by a period character ('.') followed by
   the local rule name (i.e. "alias.name").  To continue the example
   above, if the ruleset at http://example.com/rfc9999 were to have a
   rule named 'encoding', rules in the ruleset importing it can refer to
   that rule as 'rfc9999.encoding'.

   If an import directive does not specify an alias with the 'as'
   keyword, the local names of the imported ruleset effectively become
   local to the importing ruleset, except that a referenced name without
   an alias is sought in the importing ruleset before being sought in
   each of the unaliased imported rulesets.

7.  Tips and Tricks

7.1.  Any Member with Any Value

   Because member names may be specified with regular expressions, it is
   possible to construct a member rule that matches any member name.  As
   an example, the following defines an object with a member with any
   name that has a value that is a string:

                              { // : string }

                                 Figure 58

   The JSON below matches the above rule.

                             { "foo" : "bar" }

                                 Figure 59

   Likewise, the JSON below also matches the same rule.

Internet-Draft             JSON Content Rules                 April 2018


                            { "fuzz" : "bazz" }

                                 Figure 60

   Constructing an object with a member of any name with any type would
   therefore take the form:

                               { // : any }

                                 Figure 61

   The above rule matches not only the two JSON objects above, but the
   JSON object below.

                             { "fuzz" : 1234 }

                                 Figure 62

7.2.  Lists of Values

   Group specifications may be used to create enumerated lists of
   primitive data types, because primitive specifications may contain a
   group specification, which may have multiple primitive
   specifications.  Because a primitive specification must resolve to a
   single data type, the group specification must only contain choice
   combinations.

   Consider the following examples:

                ; either an IPv4 or IPv6 adress
                $address =: ( ipv4 | ipv6 )

                ; allowable fruits
                $fruits =: ( "apple" | "banana" | "pear" )

                                 Figure 63

7.3.  Groups in Arrays

   Groups may be a subordinate component of array specifications:

                       [ ( ipv4 | ipv6 ), integer ]

                                 Figure 64

   Unlike primitive specifications, subordinate group specifications in
   array specifications may have sequence combinations and contain any
   type specification.

           ; a group in an array
           [ ( $first_name, $middle_name ?, $last_name ), $age ]

           ; a group referenced from an array
           [ $name, $age ]
           $name = ( $first_name, $middle_name ?, $last_name )

           $first_name =: string
           $middle_name =: string
           $last_name =: string
           $age =: 0..

                                 Figure 65

7.4.  Groups in Objects

   Groups may be a subordinate component of object specifications:
   Subordinate group specifications in object specifications may have
   sequence combinations but must only contain member specifications.

               ; a group in an object
               { ( $title, $date, $author ), $paragraph + }

               ; a group referenced from an object
               { $front_matter, $paragraph + }
               $front_matter = ( $title, $date, $author )

               $title = "title" : string
               $date = "date" : date
               $author = "author" : [ string * ]
               $paragraph = /p[0-9]*/ : string

                                 Figure 66

      NOTE: A future specification will clarify the choice ('|')
      operation as inclusive or, exclusive or ("xor") or otherwise.  At
      present readers should assume the choice ('|') operator is an
      inclusive or.  We are in the process of defining an algorithm to
      "rewrite" choices of rules for use with inclusive or which is more
      suitable for the data model of JSON.  Such a change will impact
      the guidance given below.

   When using groups to use both sequences and choices of member
   specifications, consideration must be given to the processing of
   object specifications where by unmatched member specifications are
   ignored (see Figure 27).

Internet-Draft             JSON Content Rules                 April 2018


   A casual reading of this rule might lead a reader to believe that the
   JSON object in Figure 68 would not match, however it does because the
   extra member (either "foo" or "baz") is not matched but is ignored.

            { "bar":string, ( "foo":integer | "baz":string ) }

                                 Figure 67

                { "bar":"thing", "foo":2, "baz": "thingy" }

                                 Figure 68

   The rule in Figure 67 must be modified to either match all extra
   rules, as in Figure 69, or the logic of the rules must be rewritten
   to explicitly negate the presence of the unwanted members, as in
   Figure 70.

    { "bar":string, ( "foo":integer | "baz":string ), @{not} //:any + }

                                 Figure 69

               { "bar":string,
                 ( ( "foo":integer , @{not} "baz":string ) |
                   ( "baz":string , @{not} "foo":integer )
               ) }

                                 Figure 70

7.5.  Group Rules as Macros

   The syntax for group specifications accommodates one ore more
   subordinate components and a repetition expression for each.  Other
   than grouping multiple rules, a group specification can be used as a
   macro definition for a single rule.

                  $paragraphs = ( /p[0-9]*/ : string + )

                                 Figure 71

7.6.  Object Mixins

   Group rules can be used to create object mixins, a pattern for
   writing data models similar in style to object derivation in some
   programming languages.  In the example in below, both obj1 and obj2
   have a members "foo" and "fob" with obj1 having the additional member
   "bar" and obj2 having the additional member "baz".

Internet-Draft             JSON Content Rules                 April 2018


              $mixin_group = ( "foo" : integer, "fob" : uri )

              $obj1 = { $mixin_group, "bar" : string }

              $obj2 = { $mixin_group, "baz" : string }

                                 Figure 72

7.7.  Subordinate Dependencies

   In object and array specifications, there may be situations in which
   it is necessary to condition the existence of a subordinate component
   on the existence of a sibling subordinate component.  In other words,
   example_two should only be evaluated if example_one evaluates
   positively.  Or put another way, a member of an object or an item of
   an array may be present only on the condition that another member or
   item is present.

   In the following example, the referrer_uri member can only be present
   if the location_uri member is present.

                  ; $referrer_uri can only be present if
                  ; $location_uri is present
                  { ( $location_uri, $referrer_uri? )? }

                  $location_uri = "locationURI" : uri
                  $referrer_uri = "referrerURI" : uri

                                 Figure 73

   For validation, the above optional group is equivalent to:

                { ( $location_uri, $referrer_uri? ) | () }

                                 Figure 74

8.  Legacy Features

   JCR has evolved since its initial conception.  Often this has been as
   a result of 'in-the-field' experience.  As JCR has evolved, certain
   features have been discarded from the main specification, but should
   still be supported by implementations in order not to break
   enviroments where JCR is already deployed.  This section lists these
   deprecated features.

   For legacy support, rule name assignments to primitive type
   specifications may optionally use the character sequence '=:' instead
   of a single '=' character.

9.  Implementation Status

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7492] .
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7492] , "this will allow reviewers and working
   groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit
   of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable
   experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented protocols
   more mature.  It is up to the individual working groups to use this
   information as they see fit".

Appendix A.  Experimental Features

   The following features are in development and may appear in a future
   version of this specification.

A.1.  Augmented OR of Objects

   Augmented OR of objects is an algorithm for better writing of OR,
   where the current approach uses simple inclusive OR.  The design goal
   behind augmented OR is to give the writer and the reader a "that's
   what I meant" solution.

   For example, take the following rule for an object where two members
   are given as a choice.

                     { "foo":string | "bar":integer }

   The interpretation of Figure 77 is that the object may either contain
   a member named "foo" that is a string or a member named "bar" that is
   an integer.  To some, that raises a number of questions:

      May the object contain both "foo" and "bar"?

      May the object contain "foo" as a string and "bar" as anything
      other than an integer?

   With normal inclusive OR, it might be necessary to write more
   complicated rules to disambiguate the desired contents of the object,
   as this rule demonstrates.

                  {
                    ( "foo":string , @{not} "bar":any ) |
                    ( "bar":integer, @{not} "foo":any )
                  }

                                 Figure 78

   The augmented OR algorithm for objects would allow Figure 77 to mean
   the equivalent as the Figure 78 using inclusive OR.

A.2.  New Data Types

   JCR is intentionally designed with a rich set of data types to eas
   the burden of reading and writing rules.

   The following are a list of new data types under consideration:

      JCR currently has 'ipaddr', 'ipv4', and 'ipv6' data types, but
      often groups of IP addresses are specified using CIDR notation.
      'cidr', 'cidr4', 'cidr6' are under consideration to cover these
      data types.

      The 'any' type covers all value type specifications: objects,
      arrays, and primitives.  There may be cases where narrowing to a
      specific value type is desired, so 'anyobject', 'anyarray', and
      'anyprimitive' are under consideration.

A.3.  New Annotations

   JCR can be extended through the use of annotation but also has a set
   of standard annotations.  The design philosophy for annotations are
   to provide features to the language that are not as common or do not
   have a clear, less-wordy syntax.

   The following annotations are under consideration:

      A '@{default ...}' annotation has been proposed to help the reader
      understand there may be a default value if one is not given.  This
      annotation does not provide much value for validation and is
      intended as a reading aid to provide semantic information.

      A '@{augments RULENAME}' or '@{extends RULENAME}' annotation has
      been discussed to provide a better extension mechanism of rules.

Appendix B.  Co-Constraints

   This specification defines a small set of annotations and directives
   for JCR, yet the syntax is extensible allowing for other annotations
   and directives.  [I-D.cordell-jcr-co-constraints] ("Co-Constraints
   for JCR") defines further annotations and directives which define
   more detailed constraints on JSON messages, including co-constraints
   (constraining parts of JSON message based on another part of a JSON
   message).

Appendix C.  Testing Against JSON Content Rules

   One aspect of JCR that differentiates it from other format schema
   languages are the mechanisms helpful to developers for taking a
   formal specification, such as that found in an RFC, and evolving it
   into unit tests, which are essential to producing quality protocol
   implementations.

C.1.  Locally Overriding Rules

   As mentioned in the introduction, one tool for testing would be the
   ability to locally override named rules.  As an example, consider the
   following rule which defines an array of strings.

                         $statuses = [ string * ]

                                 Figure 79

   Consider the specification where this rule is found does not define
   the values but references an extensible list of possible values
   updated independently of the specification, such as in an IANA
   registry.

   If a software developer desired to test a specific situation in which
   the array must at least contain the status "accepted", the rules from
   the specification could be used and the statuses rule could be
   explicitly overridden locally as:

   This rule will evaluate positively with the JSON in Figure 81

             $statuses = @{unordered} [ "accepted", string * ]

                                 Figure 80

                 [ "submitted", "validated", "accepted" ]

                                 Figure 81

   Alternatively, the developer may need to ensure that the status
   "denied" should not be present in the array:

   This rule will fail to evaluate the JSON in Figure 83 thus signaling
   a problem.

         $statuses = @{unordered} @{not} [ "denied" + , string * ]

                                 Figure 82

                  [ "submitted", "validated", "denied" ]

                                 Figure 83

C.2.  Rule Callbacks

   In many testing scenarios, the evaluation of rules may become more
   complex than that which can be expressed in JCR, sometimes involving
   variables and interdependencies which can only be expressed in a
   programming language.

   A JCR processor may provide a mechanism for the execution of local
   functions or methods based on the name of a rule being evaluated.
   Such a mechanism could pass to the function the data to be evaluated,
   and that function could return to the processor the result of
   evaluating the data in the function.

Appendix D.  Changes from -09 and -10

   The syntax of JCR was changed so that rule name assignments to
   primitive types no longer requires the '=:' syntax.  The '=:' is
   still provided for backwards compatibility.  Other syntax changes
   have been made to accommodate the syntax of future annotations.
