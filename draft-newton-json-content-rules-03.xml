                This document describes a language useful for documenting the expected content of JSON structures
                found in specifications using JSON.

        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>
                The goal of this document is to provide a way to document the expected content
                of data expressed in <xref target="RFC4627">JSON</xref> format. That is, the primary
                purpose of this document is to specify a means for one person to communicate with
                another person the expected nature of a JSON data structure in a method more concise
                than prose. The programmatic validation of a JSON data structure against content rules
                is a lesser goal of this document, though such a practice is useful in both the
                writing of specifications and the communications of programs.
            </t>
            <t>
                Unlike JSON Schema, this language is not JSON though the syntax described here
                is "JSON-like" (a comparison with JSON Schema can be found in <xref target="json-schema-comparison"></xref>
                and a "real world" example can be found in <xref target="real-world-example"></xref>). 
                A specialized syntax is used to reduce the tedium in reading and
                writing rules as the complexity describing allowable content is often more involved
                than most of the actual content.
                <xref target="rfc4627-example-2-rules"></xref> is an example of
                this language describing the JSON of <xref target="rfc4627-example-2"></xref>.

            <t>
                The JSON Content Rules are of five types:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>value rules</t>
                    <t>member rules</t>
                    <t>array rules</t>
                    <t>object rules</t>
                    <t>group rules</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                Each rule has two components, a rule name and a rule definition. Anywhere in a
                rule definition where a rule name is allowed, another rule definition may be used.
            </t>
            <t>
                This is an example of a value rule:
                <list style="empty"><t>v1 : integer 0..3</t></list>
                It specifies a rule named "v1" that has a definition of ": integer 0..3" (value rule definitions
                begin with a ':' character). This defines
                values of type "v1" to be integers in the range 0 to 3 (minimum value of 0, maximum value of 3).
                Value rules can define the limits of JSON values, such as stating that numbers must fall
                into a certain range or that strings must be formatted according to certain patterns or standards
                (i.e. URIs, phone numbers, etc...).
            </t>
            <t>
                Member rules specify JSON object members. The following example member rule states that
                the rules name is 'm1' with a value defined by the 'v1' value rule:
                <list style="empty"><t>m1 "m1name" v1</t></list>
                Since rule names can be substituted by rule definitions, this member rule can also
                be written as follows:
                <list style="empty"><t>m1 "m1name" : integer 0..3</t></list>
            </t>
            <t>
                Object rules are composed of member rules, since JSON objects are composed of members.
                Object rules can specify members that are mandatory, optional, and even choices between
                members. In this example, the rule 'o1' defines an object that must contain a member
                as defined by member rule 'm1' and optionally a member defined by the rule 'm2':
                <list style="empty"><t>o1 { m1, ?m2 }</t></list>
            </t>
            <t>
                Finally, array rules are composed of value and object rules. Like object rules, array rules
                can specify the cardinality of the contents of an array. The following array rule
                defines an array that must contain value rule 'v1' and zero or more objects as defined
                by rule 'o1':
                <list style="empty"><t>a1 [ v1, *o1 ]</t></list>
            </t>

                There is no statement terminator and therefore no need for a line continuation syntax.
                Blank lines are allowed.
            </t>
            <t>
                Comments are very similar to comments in <xref target="RFC4234">ABNF</xref>. They start with a semi-colon (';') and
                continue to the end of the line.
            </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Rules">
            <t>
                Rules are composed of two parts, a rule name and a rule definition. Rule names allow
                a rule definition to be referenced easily by a name. With the exception of value rules,
                rule definitions refer to other rules using the rule names of other appropriate types
                of rules. Because of this, it is also possible to use a rule definition of the appropriate
                type where a rule name of that type would be appropriate.
            </t>
            <t>
                The type of rule to use in a rule definition, either directly or by reference of a name,
                depends on the type of rule being defined and fall along the structure of allowable JSON
                grammar:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>
                        Since a member of a JSON object can contain a "primitive value", an array, or
                        an object, member rules can be composed of value rules, array rules, and object rules.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        JSON objects are composed of members, so object rules can only be composed of
                        member rules.
                    </t>
                    <t>
                        Finally, as JSON arrays may contain other arrays, objects, and values, array
                        rules may be composed of value rules, object rules, and array rules.
                    </t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                A fifth rule type, group rules, exist to help reference a collection of rules.
            </t>
            <t>
                Rule names must start with an alphabetic character (a-z,A-Z) and must contain only
                alphabetic characters, numeric characters, the hyphen character ('-') and the
                underscore character ('_'). Rule names must not be used more than once.
            </t>
        <section title="Value Rules">
            <t>
                Value rules define content for JSON values. JSON allows values to be objects, arrays,
                numbers, booleans, strings, and null. Arrays and objects are handled by the array and object
                rules, and the value rules define the rest.
            </t>
            <section title="Numbers, Booleans and Null">
            <t>
                The rules for booleans and null are the simplest and take the following forms:
                <list style="empty">
                    <t>rule_name : boolean</t>
                    <t>rule_name : null</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                Rules for numbers can specify the number as either an integer or floating point number
                and may specify a range:
                <list style="empty">
                    <t>rule_name : integer n..m</t>
                    <t>rule_name : float n..m</t>
                </list>
                where n is the minimum allowable value of the number and m is the maximum allowable value of the
                number. The range doesn't have to be given, but if it is given either the minimum, maximum,
                or both are required. If the minimum is not given then the minimum is considered to be the 
                minimum number value possible to represent in JSON. Likewise, if the maximum is not given then
                the maximum is considered to be the maximum number value possible to represent in JSON.
            </t>
            </section>
            <section title="Strings">
            <t>
                String values may be specified generically as:
                <list style="empty"><t>rule_name : string</t></list>
                However, the content of strings can be narrowed in the following ways:
                <list style="hanging">
                    <t hangText="Regular Expression: ">
                        A rule can state that a string must match a regular expression
                        by giving the regular expression after the string literal:
                        <list style="empty"><t>rule_name : string /regex/</t></list>
                    </t>
                    <t hangText="URIs and URI templates: ">
                        A rule can state that a string must be a <xref target="RFC3986">URI</xref>:
                        <list style="empty"><t>rule_name : uri</t></list>
                        URIs may be further scoped to a specific URI pattern by prepending
                        a <xref target="RFC6570">URI template</xref>:
                        <list style="empty"><t>rule_name : uri http://{stuff}</t></list>

        <section title="Member Rules">
            <t>
                Member rules are the simplest of the rules and define members of JSON objects.
                Member rules follow the format:
                <list style="empty"><t>rule_name "member_name" target_rule_name</t></list>
                where rule_name is the name of the rule being defined, member_name (in quotes) is
                the name of the JSON object member, and target_rule_name is a reference to a value
                rule, array rule, or object rule specifying the allowable content of the JSON object member.
            </t>
            <t>
                Since rule names in rule definitions may be substituted for rule definitions,
                member rules may also be written in this form:
                <list><t>rule_name "member_rule" target_rule_definition</t></list>
                The following is an example:
                <list style="empty"><t>location_uri "locationURI" : uri</t></list>
            </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Object Rules">
            <t>
                Object rules define the allowable members of a JSON object. Their rule definitions
                are composed of member rules and group rules. They take the following form:
                <list style="empty"><t>rule_name { member_rule_1, member_rule_2 }</t></list>
                The following rule example defines an object composed of two member rules:
                <list style="empty"><t>response { location_uri, status_code }</t></list>
            </t>
            <t>
                Given the general rule that where a rule name is found a rule definition
                of the appropriate type may be used, the above example might also be
                written:
                <list style="empty"><t>response { "locationUri" : uri, "statusCode" : integer }</t></list>
            </t>
            <t>
                Rules given in the rule definition of an object rule do not imply order. Given the example
                object rule above both
                <list style="empty"><t>{ "locationUri" : "http://example.com", "statusCode" : 200 }</t></list>
                and
                <list style="empty"><t>{ "statusCode" : 200, "locationUri" : "http://example.com" }</t></list>
                are JSON objects that match the rule.
            </t>
            <t>
                Member rules or member rule definitions may not be repeated in the rule definition
                of an object rule. However, a member of an object can be marked as optional if the
                member rule defining it is preceded by the question mark ('?') character. In the
                following example, the location_uri member is optional while the status_code member
                is required to be in the defined object:
                <list style="empty"><t>response { ?location_uri, status_code }</t></list>
            </t>
            <t>
                An object rule can also define the choice between members by placing the forward slash ('/')
                character between two member rules. In the following example, the object being
                defined can have either a location_uri member or content_type member and must
                have a status_code member:
                <list style="empty"><t>response { location_uri / content_type, status_code }</t></list>
            </t>
            <t>
                Finally, the specification of a member of an object can be conditioned upon the
                the specification of another member of that object by placing the ampersand ('&amp;')
                character between two member rules. Using this syntax, the member defined by the
                second rule is only allowed in the object if the member defined by the first rule
                is given. Or in other words, the appearance of the second member depends upon the
                appearance of the first member. In the following example, the object defined can
                have a referrer_uri so long as location_uri is also present:
                <list style="empty"><t>response { location_uri &amp; referrer_uri }</t></list>
            </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Array Rules">
            <t>
                Array rules define the allowable content of JSON arrays. Their rule definitions
                are composed of value rules, object rules, group rules, and other array rules and have the following
                form:
                <list style="empty"><t>rulename [ target_rule_name_1, target_rule_name_2 ]</t></list>
                The following example defines an array where element 1 is defined by the width_value rule
                and element 2 is defined by the height_value rule:
                <list style="empty"><t>size [ width_value, height_value ]</t></list>
            </t>
            <t>
                Unlike object rules, order is implied by the array rule definition. That is,
                the first rule referenced or defined within an array rule specifies that the first
                element of the array will match that rule, the second rule given with the array rule
                specifies that the second element of the array will match that rule, and so on.
            </t>
            <t>
                Take for example the following array rule definition:
                <list style="empty"><t>person [ : string, : integer ]</t></list>
                This JSON array matches the above rule:
                <list style="empty"><t>[ "Bob Smurd", 24 ]</t></list>
                while this one does not:
                <list style="empty"><t>[ 24, "Bob Smurd" ]</t></list>
            </t>
            <t>
                As with object rules, the forward slash character ('/') can be used to indicate
                a choice between two elements. Take for example the following rules:
                <list style="empty">
                    <t>name_value : string</t>
                    <t>age_value : integer</t>
                    <t>birthdate_value : date-time</t>
                    <t>person [ name_value, age_value / birthdate_vale ]</t>
                </list>
                which would validate
                <list style="empty"><t>[ "Bob Smurd", 24 ]</t></list>
                or
                <list style="empty"><t>[ "Bob Smurd", "1988-04-12T23:20:50.52Z" ]</t></list>
            </t>
            <t>
                Repetition of array values may also be specified by preceding a rule with an
                asterisk ('*') character surrounded by the lower bound and upper bound of
                the repetition (e.g. "0*1"). The following rules define an array that has
                between one and three strings:
                <list style="empty">
                    <t>child_value : string</t>
                    <t>children [ 1*3 child_value ]</t>
                </list>
                Both the lower bound and the upper bound are optional. If lower bound is not
                given then it is assumed to be zero. If the upper bound is not given then it
                is assumed to be infinity. The following example defines an array with an
                infinite number of child_value defined strings:
                <list style="empty"><t>children [ * child_value ]</t></list>
            </t>
        </section>
        <section title="Group Rules">
            <t>
                Unlike the other types of rules, group rules have no direct tie with JSON syntax.
                Group rules simply group together other rules. They take the form:
                <list style="empty"><t>rule_name ( target_rule_1, target_rule_2 )</t></list>
            </t>
            <t>
                Group rule definitions and any nesting of group rule definitions, must conform
                to the allowable set of rules of the rule containing them. A group rule referenced
                inside of an array rule may not contain a member rule since member rules are not
                allowed in array rules directly. Likewise, a group rule referenced inside an object
                rule must only contain member rules, and once group rules used in an object rule are
                fully dereferenced there must be no duplicate member rules as member rules in
                object rules are required to be unique.
            </t>
            <t>
                Take for example the following rules:
                <list style="empty">
                    <t>child_1 "first_child" : string</t>
                    <t>child_2 "second_child" : string</t>
                    <t>child_3 "third_child" : string</t>
                    <t>child_4 "fourth_child" : string</t>
                    <t>first_two_children ( child_1, child_2 )</t>
                    <t>second_two_children ( child_3, child_4 )</t>
                    <t>the_children { first_two_children, second_two_children }</t>
                </list>
                These rules describe a JSON object that might look like this:
                <list style="empty">
                    <t>{ "first_child":"greg", "second_child":"marsha", "third_child":"bobby", "fourth_child":"jan" }</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                Groups can also be used with the choice and dependency syntax in member rules. Here
                the object can either have first_two_children or second_two_children:
                <list style="empty"><t>the_children { first_two_children / second_two_children }</t></list>
                and here the object can have second_two_children only if first_two_children are given:
                <list style="empty"><t>the_children { first_two_children &amp; second_two_children }</t></list>
            </t>
            <t>
                Group rules can be used to create object mixins. In the example in <xref target="group_mixin_example"></xref>,
                both obj1 and obj2 have a members "foo" and "fob" with obj1 having the additional member "bar"
                and obj2 having the additional member "baz".
            </t>

        </section>
        <section title="Any Value and Any Member">
            <t>
                It is possible to specify that a value can be of any type allowable
                by JSON using the any value rule. This is done with the 'any' literal in
                a value rule:
                <list style="empty"><t>rule_name : any</t></list>
                However, unlike other value rules which define primitive data types,
                this rule defines a value of any kind, either primitive (null, boolean,
                number, string), object, or array.
            </t>
            <t>
                Use of the any value rule in arrays can be used with repetition to define
                arrays that may contain any value:
                <list style="empty">
                    <t>any_value : any</t>
                    <t>array_of_any [ *any_value ]</t>
                </list>
            </t>
            <t>
                Specifying any object member name in a member rule with the any member rule
                is done by pre-pending
                a carat character ('^') to an empty member name (that is, ^"" signifies
                any member name). This has the following
                form:
                <list style="empty"><t>rule_name ^"" target_rule_name</t></list>
                As an example, the following defines an object member with any name
                that has a value that is a string:
                <list style="empty"><t>user_data ^"" : string</t></list>
                Usage of the any member rule must still satisfy the criteria that all
                member names of an object be unique.
            </t>
            <t>
                Constructing an object member of any name with any type would therefore
                take the form:
                <list style="empty"><t>rule_name ^"" : any</t></list>
            </t>
            <t>
                Unlike other types of member rules, it is possible to use repetition with
                the any member rule in an object rule. The repetition syntax and semantics are
                the same as the repetition syntax and semantics of repetition with array rules.
                The following example rules define an object that may contain any number of
                members where each member may have any value.
                <list style="empty">
                    <t>any_member ^"" : any</t>

                Use of the repetition of any member rules must satisfy the criteria that
                all member names of an object be unique.

            <section title="A Root Rule">
                <t>
                    In some contexts it is necessary that there be a rule that defines
                    the outer most JSON object or array, or if thought of as an inverted object tree
                    the structure at the very top. If in a collection of rules there is no rule
                    explicitly specified for this purpose and a rule named "root" is given, it
                    can be assumed to be the outer most JSON structure or the root of an
                    object/array tree. If a rule is explicitly specified other than "root" and
                    there exists a rule named "root", that rule name holds no special meaning.

        <section title="Directives">
            <t>
                Directives change the interpretation of a collection of rules. They begin with a hash character ('#')
                and are terminated by the end of a line. They take the following form:
                <list style="empty"><t># directive_name</t></list>
                Directives may have other qualifiers after the directive name. They may appear intermixed with rules
                but cannot appear in a rule definition.
            </t>
            <section title="ignore-unknown-members">
                <t>
                    This directive specifies that any member of any object which has
                    not been specified should be ignored. Ignored object members may have
                    a value of any type. This directive cannot be used in any collection
                    of rules that has an any member rule.

                <t>
                    This directive specifies that every member name of every object,
                    either explicitly defined or specified via an any member rule or
                    the ignore-unknown-members directive must be a name compatible with programming
                    languages. The intent is to specify object member names that may
                    be promoted to first-order object attributes or methods in
                    an API. The following ABNF describes the restrictions upon the

                    The quoted string may be optionally followed by a URI:

        <section title="Alternate Syntax">
            <t>
                The syntax given in the sections above does require specific knowledge of JSON content
                rules and may not be appropriate for describing simpler JSON structures or may not be
                desired for describing JSON to audiences unfamiliar with JSON content rules. In other
                words, choice of syntax is a matter of style and taste and can vary depending on
                conditions.
            </t>
            <t>
                Therefore this section describes a syntax mapping where symbols are substituted for
                words, thus providing a more readable rule set to some audiences. Because it is a
                simple mapping between symbols and words, the structure of the rules does not change
                and the syntaxes may be interchanged.
            </t>
            <t>
                The syntax map is as follows:
                <list style="empty">
                    <t>: (colon) maps to the word VALUE</t>
                    <t>{ (left curly bracket) maps to OBJECT</t>
                    <t>} (right curly bracket) maps to END_OBJECT</t>
                    <t>, (comma) maps to AND</t>
                    <t>/ (forward slash) maps to OR</t>
                    <t>&amp; (ampersand) maps to DEPENDS</t>
                    <t>[ (left square bracket) maps to ARRAY</t>
                    <t>] (right square bracket) maps to END_ARRAY</t>
                    <t>( (left parenthesis) maps to GROUP</t>
                    <t>) (right parenthesis) maps to END_GROUP</t>
                    <t>&lt; (less than symbol) maps to ENUM</t>
                    <t>&gt; (greater than symbol) maps to END_ENUM</t>
                </list>
                Because member names in member rules must be quoted strings, there is
                no need to map the quotation marks. However the word MEMBER can precede the
                quoted string in member rules.
            </t>
            <t>
                The carat symbol used in any rules and the asterisk symbol used for
                specifying cardinality do not have a mapping as there are probably no
                good words to describe their usage. Additionally, directives do not
                have mappings as they are descriptive.
            </t>
            <t>
                The following are examples of the symbolic syntax and the alternate word
                syntax:

            <section title="Member Uniqueness">
                <t>
                    JSON does not disallow non-unique object member names (
                    in other words, it allows non-unique object member names )
                    but strongly advises against the use of non-unique object
                    member names. Many JSON implementations use hash-indexed maps
                    to represent JSON objects, where the object's member names are
                    the key of the hash index. Non-uniqueness would break
                    such implementations or result in the value of the last member
                    given overwriting the value of all previous members of the
                    same name.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Therefore, allowing non-unique object member names would be
                    bad practice. For this reason, this specification does not
                    accommodate the need for non-unique object member names.
                </t>
            </section>
            <section title="Member Order">
                <t>
                    JSON gives awkward guidance regarding ordering of
                    object member names. However, many JSON implementations
                    use hash-indexed maps to represent JSON objects, where the object's
                    member names are the key of the hash index. Though it is
                    possible, usually these maps have no explicit order as
                    the only index is the hash.
                </t>
                <t>
                    Therefore, this specification does not provide a means
                    to imply order of object member names.
                </t>
            </section>
            <section title="Group Syntax for Arrays and Objects">
                <t>
                    It is possible to create a separate group syntax for
                    array rules vs object rules, since allowable group rule content
                    is determined by the containing rule. For instance, while the
                    syntax for groups in objects could have been "( blah blah )",
                    syntax for groups in arrays could have been "&lt; blah blah &gt;".
                    That may be more distinctive and allow the formal syntax parser
                    to handle rule content validity, but the added extra syntax
                    appeared to hurt readability. There is only so many enclosure
                    characters a person should reasonably be required to know, and
                    adding yet another did not seem prudent.
                </t>
            </section>
            <section title="Inspiration">
                <t>The original approach to this problem was to find a concise
                way to describe JSON data structures; to do for JSON what
                RelaxNG compact syntax does for XML. The syntax itself hopefully
                has a JSON-ness or a JSON feel to it. And a good bit of
                inspiration came from ABNF.</t>
